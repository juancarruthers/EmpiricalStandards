# Qualitative Surveys (Interview Studies) 
<standard name="Qualitative Surveys (Interview Studies)">



_<desc>Research comprising semi-structured or open-ended interviews</desc>_


## Application 

This standard applies to empirical inquiries that meet all of the
following criteria:

-   Researcher(s) have synchronous conversations with one participant at
    a time
-   Researchers ask, and participants answer, open-ended questions
-   Participants' answers are recorded in some way
-   Researchers apply some kind of qualitative data analysis to
    participants' answers

If researchers iterated between data collection and analysis, consider
the **Grounded Theory Standard**. If respondents are all from the same
organization, consider the **Case Study Standard**. If researchers
collect written text or conversations (e.g. StackExchange threads),
consider the **Discourse Analysis Standard**.

## Specific Attributes

### Essential Attributes	
<checklist name="Essential">

<method>    
    
- [ ]	explains how interviewees were selected (see the [Sampling Supplement](https://github.com/acmsigsoft/EmpiricalStandards/blob/master/Supplements/Sampling.md))
- [ ]	describes interviewees (e.g. demographics, work roles)
- [ ]   describes interviewer(s) (e.g. experience, perspective)     
    
<results>    
    
- [ ]	presents clear chain of evidence from interviewee quotations to findings (e.g. proposed concepts)
- [ ]	clearly answers the research question(s)
- [ ]	provides evidence of saturation; explains how saturation was achieved<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>
    
<discussion>
    
 - [ ]   researchers reflect on their own possible biases   
    
</checklist>
     
### Desirable Attributes	
<checklist name="Desirable">

- [ ]	provides supplemental materials including interview guide(s), coding schemes, coding examples, decision rules, or extended chain-of-evidence table(s)
- [ ]	includes highly diverse participants
- [ ]	uses direct quotations extensively to support key points
- [ ]	EITHER: evaluates an a priori theory (or model, framework, taxonomy, etc.) using deductive coding with an a priori coding scheme based on the prior theory    
     OR: synthesizes results into a new, mature, fully-developed and clearly articulated theory (or model, etc.) using some form of inductive coding (coding scheme generated from data)
- [ ]   validates results using member checking, dialogical interviewing, feedback from non-participant practitioners or research audits of coding by advisors or other researchers<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup>)
- [ ]	discusses transferability; findings plausibly transferable to different contexts
- [ ]	compares results with (or integrates them into) prior theory or related research
- [ ]	reflects on how researchers’ biases may have affected their analysis
</checklist>
     
### Extraordinary Attributes	
<checklist name="Extraordinary">

- [ ]	employs multiple methods of data analysis (e.g. open coding vs. process coding; manual coding vs. automated sentiment analysis) with method-triangulation
- [ ]	employs longitudinal design (i.e. each interviewee participates multiple times) and analysis
- [ ]	employs probabilistic sampling strategy; statistical analysis of response bias
- [ ]	uses multiple coders and analyzes inter-coder reliability (see [IRR/IRA Supplement](https://github.com/acmsigsoft/EmpiricalStandards/blob/master/Supplements/InterRaterReliabilityAndAgreement.md))
</checklist>

## General Quality Criteria

An interview study should address appropriate qualitative quality
criteria such as: **credibility,** **resonance**, **usefulness**, and
**transferability** (see **Glossary**). Quantitative quality criteria
such as internal validity, construct validity, generalizability and
reliability typically do not apply.

## Examples of Acceptable Deviations

-   In a study of deaf software developers, the interviews are conducted
    via text messages.
-   In a study of sexual harassment at named organizations, detailed
    description of interviewees and direct quotations are omitted to
    protect participants.
-   In a study of barriers faced by gay developers, participants are all
    gay (but should be diverse on other dimensions).

## Antipatterns 

-   Interviewing a small number of similar people, creating the illusion
    of convergence and saturation
-   Mis-presenting a qualitative survey as grounded theory or a case
    study.

## Invalid Criticisms 

-   Lack of quantitative data; causal analysis; objectivity, internal
    validity, reliability, or generalizability.
-   Lack of replicability or reproducibility; not releasing transcripts.
-   Lack of probability sampling, statistical generalizability or
    representativeness unless representative sampling was an explicit
    goal of the study.
-   Failure to apply grounded theory or case study practices. A
    qualitative survey is not grounded theory or a case study.

## Notes 

-   A qualitative survey generally has more interviews than a case study
    that triangulates across different kinds of data.
